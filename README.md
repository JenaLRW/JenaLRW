## Hi there 👋 My name is Jena White!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Google Maps API for a HOA I work for.  They have just under 200 members and I created a membership database through MailPoet in Wordpress.  I'd like to develop an interactive map of their neighborhood when the mouse hovers a property lot, a blurb would appear to show information of the homeowner and the property. Unfortauntely, this would be for members eyes only.  I plan to make a copy and do a smaller public neighbhorhood elsewhere such as a shopping mall just to demonstrate my skills.

- 💻 I need to clean up my first capstone and make it work more efficiently and blow recruiter's minds.  Priorities! 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python on my own pace.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on my business, DeafHat.com.  Another business partner started this project on the side and already established a LMS (Learning Management System) and curcirrulum for several IT classes such as Python, Google Sheets, Github, etc. We are looking for grants, investors, students, teachers, and any kind of support.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to build of all sizes.  I have built viruses in academic and research laboratories using RNA.  I built my current home and horse barn.  I have built a few playsets and decks. I helped my husband rebuild engines. And now I'm building stuff on the world wide web!  I love it all.

- 🏕️ Hobbies: Horseback riding.  I have a off track Thoroughbred named Scott. Boating and camping with my family. Spending time with my girlfriends.
